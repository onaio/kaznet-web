Adds ability to create, list, update, delete and retrieve Locations.

Once a Location is created it's stored in the database and can be retrieved from the API as shown below. Only Admins Can interact with this API Endpoint

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/v1/locations

Creates a new location, requires a `name`.

```console
curl -x POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"name": "HappyLand"}' https://example.com/api/v1/locations
```

The `name` is a *string*. It can take additional inputs in the content such as:

- `parent`: *integer*, is the unique identifier for a parent location object.
- `country`: *string*, is the country code of a country.
- `geopoint`: *string*, is a comma separated string specifying longtitude and latitude. Longtitude should be written first followed by a comma then the latitude. **If geopoint is specified, radius should be inputed and shapefile shouldn't be uploaded.**
- `radius`: *decimal*. **If radius is specified, geopoint should be inputted and shapefile shouldn't be uploaded.**
- `shapefile`: *shapefile*, is a *.zip* file containing strictly three files, the *.shp*, *.shx* and *.dbf* files. **If shapefile is uploaded, geopoint and radius shouldn't be inputted.**
