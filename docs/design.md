# Design Guidelines

High level design goals/guidelines are:

* Clean standards-compliant code.
* Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Don't repeat yourself
* As-good-as-possible Documentation.
* A small set of orthogonal features.  If two features are very similar, one should be removed.
* Attempt to remain responsive to the user at all times.  Handle all exceptions and don't break randomly - the user should always be able to do what they want to do.
* Set sane defaults so that users do not have to mess with configuration.
* Features should be as easy as possible for the user to discover.
* Everything should be designed with the user in mind.  Write no line of code until you've thought the whole thing through and documented it.
